# Gardex

## Available sensors:
* Brightness
* Moisture
* Temperature

## Avaiable outputs:
* Pump / Valve

## My plans
* [ ] Add support for analogue sensors
* [ ] Pumps should be triggered on certain conditions, defined in a pot
* [ ] It should be possible to connect to a weather forecast service
* [ ] Make it possible to configure the project easily (sensors, â€¦)
* [ ] There are no tests yet, probably the watering logic should get some tests.
* [ ] Write logs of all sensors in a sqlite database
* [ ] Webinterface (Plug or Phoenix) to monitor all sensors and pots

## Contribution

### Installation
To build the project you have to setup all dependencies of nerves. They have a very simple [installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html).

### Configuring
You have to configure your target ([supported targets](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html)) in the `mix.exs` file and setup your sensors/pump in `lib/gardex.ex`.

### Building
- `mix compile`
- `mix firmware`
- `mix firmware.burn`
